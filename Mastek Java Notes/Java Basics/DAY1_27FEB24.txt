Java 
Architecture 
	a. JDK -> Java Development Kit     ->will have files/exe which will support building of java app
	b. JRE -> Java Runtime Environment ->supports execution application build on java
	C. jvm -> java virtual machine 
				.java -> compile-> .class
				.class-> executed
JDK8 	
>=JDK9 -> modules 	

Oracle Database=>installer =>JRE

install -> 32 bit
		   64 bit
		   
	path
	classpath
	JAVA_HOME
============================================================================
1. Keywords
2. data type
3. variable.: types of variable, scope variable
4. Opearators
5. Dicision Control statement: ifelse,switch case
6. Looping  Control statement: do-while,while,for-loop,enhanced forloop
7. Array, Collection,Generics,lambda
8. Reusable -> Function 
9. OOP class,object, OOP principle
============================================================================
Why?
	*SEcure : Two way checking of the .class 
		
	1. Platform independant 
	JVM ->OS dependant 
		->.class which is platform independant 
	2. Scalable 
		OOP 
			Abstraction
			Encapsulation
			Inheritance
			Polymorphism 
	3. Threading
	4. Collection
	5. JDBC
	6. Servelt & JSP 
	7. Packaging

What?
How ?
############################################################################################
Step 1 >javac Main.java =>Main.class
Step 2 >java Main 


Step1 -> a. Syntax -> Main.class
Step2 -> java Main-> loading the class-> checking is it valid file-> if valid -> output
																	 else     -> error							
############################################################################################
1. .java file must have one public class and it should be saved with the name of public class
	e.g. public class Greeting {} => Greeting.java 
		 public class Main2 {}  => Main2.java
2. Class name are meaning full and following PascalCase


How to create main classes in java?
How to complie the classes ?
How to create an object of an class?
How to call a method of another class using an object?

we understood what is package?
How to compile the code which has first line as package -> javac -d . *.java 
How to execute -> java com.training.Main3 (using the classified name of the class)
How to import classes from the other package? -> import -> public 
com.training.Main3.java
com.training.Greeting.java
org.training.Greeting.java

d:\workspace\javaws
c:\workspace\javaws

com.training.zomato
com.training.swiggy

//local variable : declared within the functions exist within that function 
1. local varialbe has block scope {} 
2. must have data type metioned and initialized before use
3. depending on it type 
	variable -> cameCase	->num1,num2 
	constatnt -> CAPITALCASE
	Name of variable is alphanumeric starting always with character numbers can come from 2nd positon
	and it also supports _
Types of methods:
1. Static Methods : marked with static keyword 
	
//Static Methods 
public static void main(String[] args) {}
Static method can call static methods only 
i.e. another method marked with static keyword 
2. Non Static method : which is not marked static 
publi add(int num1,int num2){
}
To call a non-static method in static method we must create an object of the class

Main main=new Main();

Main main=>variable in your function pointing to the real object 
new Main()=>actual object which has a memory
new	=>keyword used to allocate a memory to object
Main()=> default constructor/non parameterised constructor 
	=> used in allocation of memory along with new keyword and always returns object
	=> Its a special method which don't have a return type

add
sub
mul

Creating project certain -> business need
package-> com.zomato
			controller
			view
			model 
			
use case - > package
use case -> 
Main.class
